<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This class covers core concepts of mobile application development with a focus on the Android platform. You will learn key skills used by professional Android mobile developers by designing, developing and publishing<span> a fully-functional mobile application that you can reference for job applications or future projects. </span></p>
<h3><span>Objectives</span></h3>
<p><span>In this class, you will learn how to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Build apps targeting different mobile-device form factors and OS versions</li>
<li>Design for mobile-specific UI &amp; performance constraints</li>
<li>Interact with device hardware and OS services&nbsp;</li>
<li>Interact with external web services from the Android context</li>
<li>Complete technical and administrative steps for publishing a mobile app</li>
</ul>
<p>Class examples will be taught using Java and I expect your homework submissions to be written in Java. If you wish, you may pursue an extra credit project that includes programming in C++ or Kotlin.</p>
<h3>Required Materials</h3>

</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If there's a topic you want to cover, let me know! Or, if there's a topic that everyone is struggling with, I may adjust the schedule to spend more time on it.</p>
<h3>Class structure</h3>
<p>As a hybrid course, class work will be split between in-person sessions and online activities.</p>
<p>You will complete readings, videos, and other course materials outside of class in place of some in-person lecture. When you come into class, I will assume that you have completed the readings assigned for that week.</p>
<p>In-class time will focus heavily on hands-on learning through labs and coding exercises, with occasional lectures. Please bring your questions from the readings or homework with you to the in-class sessions.</p>
<h3>Getting stuck and discussions</h3>
<p>If you find yourself stuck on one problem, issue, or blocker for more than 30 minutes, please ask for help. I highly suggest that you post your question to our class discussion board. Some of your classmates are likely to have the same question. I will keep an eye on class discussions and respond as quickly as I can.</p>
<p>If you need a really speedy response, you can send me an email or message me directly through Canvas. If you try to contact me through another channel--e.g. Slack--I am unlikely to respond very quickly.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>The following table shows the weight of graded activities in the course.</p>

| Activity                 | Grade percentage     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Assignments              | 70%                  |
| Quiz 1                   | 10%                  |
| Quiz 2                   | 10%                  |
| Final exam               | 10%                  |
| Extra credit project     | TBD (per instructor discretion) |

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Assignments</h3>
<p>Coding assignments will be posted on Canvas each Thursday (starting April 4th) and are designed to exercise the skills and concepts covered that week.</p>
<p>Assignments are due by the start of class on the following Wednesday before class. Late assignments may be automatically marked down by 10%.</p>
<p>To receive full credit, you must publish your completed assignments to your GitHub.com repository and submit the repository link in Canvas. You must put the app files for each homework in a new folder at the root of your repository. Your repository folder structure should look something like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Repository root]
<ul>
<li>HW0
<ul>
<li>[Files for homework]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HW1
<ul>
<li>[Files for homework]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HW2
<ul>
<li>[Files for homework]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please include only the files required to run your homework in your submissions. You must configure your .gitignore file to exclude files like *.iml, local.properties, or folders like .idea.</p>
<p>You may discuss how to approach a problem with other students in the class, but your submission must be your own work. Submissions that are substantially identical would be considered cheating and subject to a markdown penalty.</p>
<h3>Quizzes</h3>
<p>Quizzes will be administered via Canvas and must be completed during the specified time frame to receive credit. Each quiz will include a combination of multiple-choice questions and short answer coding questions.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, you don't need to write beautiful, compile-ready code in the short answer coding questions. You aren't likely to lose points if your code is missing a curly brace or semi-colon (unless your code is otherwise unreadable).</p>
<p>Each quiz will focus on the topics presented since the last quiz. However, given that the material in this course builds on previous modules, you will be expected to know some earlier material.</p>
<h3>Final exam</h3>
<p>The final exam will be held on&nbsp;<strong>Wednesday, June 12th at 6PM</strong> (our normal meeting time) and shouldn't take longer than one hour to complete. The final will be cumulative. You will be asked to answer multiple-choice, short answer, and coding questions.&nbsp; Like the quizzes, you won't be penalized for minor syntax errors.</p>
<p>I hope that you will view the final as your opportunity to show how much you know. It gives you a chance to demonstrate how much you've learned about Android development in a timed atmosphere (not unlike a job interview!).</p>
<h3>Grading criteria and rubrics</h3>
<p>Each assignment will include the rubric I will use to grade it. Pay attention to the rubric. It will tell you exactly what I'm looking for in the assignment.</p>
<p>I expect that your homework submissions will build in Android Studio and run in the Android emulator (or a mobile device) without errors.</p>
<p>You are not required to follow a specific coding style guide. However, it is highly recommended that you follow the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html">Google Java Style Guide. </a>Although I won't be looking for style violations, I prefer not to look at unreadable code. I reserve the right to be picky style guidelines if it becomes an issue.</p>
<p>At a bare minimum, I prefer that you observe the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>camelCase</code> for variable names</li>
<li>Use braces when possible, particularly to indicate execution blocks in conditionals and loops</li>
<li>Put constant names in <code>ALL_CAPS</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, please provide comments in your code to explain your thoughts about decisions you make in the code. If you get stuck on a homework (or in the coding part of a quiz), provide comments that indicate what you think needs to happen.&nbsp;I will give partial credit for thoughtful code comments!</p>
<h3>Late work</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, late work can receive an automatic 10% reduction in score. I will look at the commit history in your GitHub repository to review the last change to the files for each homework.</p>
<p>I may decide to waive penalties for late homework. If you think that you will be late with your homework, please let me know. I am more likely waive the penalties for late work if you let me know in advance.</p>
<h3>Extra credit projects</h3>
<p>If you are so interested, you can engage in a couple of different activities to earn extra credit. Please note that I will grade projects based upon their difficulty.</p>
<p>For example, you may choose to complete a homework that demonstrates your knowledge of one of the potential extra credit topics (mentioned above). Another option is that you can engage with the professional Android developer community through attending a MeetUp or interacting with other developers on StackOverflow.</p>
<p>To pursue an extra credit activity, please send me an email that outlines what you propose to do. I will coordinate with you individually about your extra credit project.</p>
